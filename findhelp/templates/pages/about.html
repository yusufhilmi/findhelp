                There is an increasing number of problems in our society. Almost all forms of violence still exists and
                number of occasion is increasing day by day. People can't find food or shelter; they lose their job
                without
                getting their payments. These are only a few of the problems. To respond and fix these problems we use
                social media channels and it is a useful medium to help. However, only a small percentage of posts are
                getting traction and the rest of problems that are shared are being lost in hundreds of thousands posts.
                There is also the fact that a help request in social media is useful only if the people or organizations
                that can help can see them. So, we created this platform to reach help requests of people to the
                organizations that can help.
