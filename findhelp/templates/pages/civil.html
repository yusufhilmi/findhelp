            Our main objective is to bring people and civil organizations together. We have started our journey to
            inform society
            about Civil Organizations and created this platform to become the bridge between people and civil
            organizations.

            <br>
            <br>
            To achieve this goal we are actively building partnerships with civil organizations. If you want to build a
            partnership with us
            or want to learn how our partnership works please keep reading.

            Our users are able to create help calls on the system. Whilst creating it, they are providing us a brief
            description of their situation, their contact information and the relevant category for them.
            <br>
            <b>Categories</b> are decided by our team considering our partnerships and our potential effect on that
            category.
            <br><br>
            After help calls we are connecting our users with a relevant civil organization.
            <br><br>
            We are gradually automating the worflow to provide email notifications at instant. With Natural Language
            Processing
            we hope to create a total automation on validating help calls and finding the most relevant civil
            organizations.
